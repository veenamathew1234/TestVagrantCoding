Assignment
Create an in-memory store for recently played songs that can accommodate N songs per user, with a fixed initial capacity. This store must have the capability to store a list of song-user pairs, with each song linked to a user. It should also be able to fetch recently played songs based on the user and eliminate the least recently played songs when the store becomes full.

src/main/java has the logic of the assignment and the main code.
src/main/test contains the test cases
  Inorder to run the program in full , i have created a sample test case which is testUserSongsCompleteFlow
  the next test case are to show you the test cases. (I have given sample  hardcoded data for ease of testing. This is given in the public constructor)
